# MindOrMatter
Mind Or Matter is a 2.5D Fighter Engine; open source project written in javascript (babylon js + jquery)

Multiplayer works locally (albeit simple), but is not functional in the Heroku url. 
Through the Heroku app you can do the following: arcade, survival, single vs, training, tutorial. 

Do note: 
Using the characters or this engine requires you to refer to Jonathan F.M. Neels. If you make profit +10.000 euro, you must give me a honest share of 2.25 percent ;).
